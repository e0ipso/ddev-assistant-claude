# Pre-install Claude Code to /usr/local/lib/claude/claude.
# This path is outside the web user's home, which DDEV mounts as a Docker named volume
# at runtime — files placed under the home directory in the image layer would be masked.
# A post-start hook (config.assistant-claude.yaml) copies the binary into
# ~/.local/bin/claude on first start so it is user-owned and on the volume.
# Using cp -L dereferences any symlinks before copying, which prevents a broken
# symlink at the destination when the installer uses relative symlinks internally.

# BASH_ENV is sourced by bash for non-interactive shells, which is how `ddev exec` runs
# commands (e.g. `bash -c "claude --version"`).  Using $HOME means this works regardless
# of which user DDEV maps into the container at runtime.
# /etc/profile.d covers login/interactive shells.
